# code-refactor
This repo is used to upload files for Week 1's weekly challenge.
This project required me to link the "search engine optimization" header link to the section itself.
This project also required me to give the website a proper name within the <head> element.
This week's project can be found at https://josephhaas.github.io/week-1-challenge/
